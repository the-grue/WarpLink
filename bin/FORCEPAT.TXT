Put FORCEPAT.OBJ first in the object module link list.

Technical explanation:  FORCEPAT.OBJ ensures that the start of the
segment $S_SETUP_DATA is paragraph aligned in a program, even though it
is normally a byte aligned segment.  Force requires that $S_SETUP_DATA
start on a paragraph boundary, but when using overlays WarpLink will
place segments before the $S_SETUP_DATA segment in the program.  This
can cause a nonparagraph alignment.
